# Biostatistics Courses

A four-course biostatistics programme in R and Quarto, hosted on GitHub Pages.
Standalone courses site, referenced from the owner's main website.

- Course 1 — Foundations of Biostatistics with R
- Course 2 — Regression, ANOVA & Model Diagnostics
- Course 3 — Study Design, Longitudinal Data & Causal Inference
- Course 4 — Modern Statistical Learning & High-Dimensional Biomedicine

Every inference lab follows the five-step template:
Hypothesis → Visualise → Assumptions → Conduct → Conclude.

Every lab renders twice from one Quarto source: as an HTML article and
as a Reveal.js slide deck.
